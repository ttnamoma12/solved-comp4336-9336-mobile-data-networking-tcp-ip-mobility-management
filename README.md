<strong>Q1</strong>. List some of the features of the IPv6 that makes it relatively (in comparison to IPv4) easier to support the concept of Mobile IP.




<strong>Q2. </strong>What are the benefits of having a foreign agent (FA)?




<strong>Q3.</strong> What are the benefits of co-located CoA (no foreign agent)







For questions 4-7, assume the following addressing scenario:




Mobile host (MH) home address:       130.20.5.5/16

Home agent (HA) address:                 130.20.6.7/16

MH care of address:                            14.50.8.8/8

Foreign agent (FA) address:               14.60.30.4/8

Corresponding host (CH) address:      200.4.7.20/24




<strong>Q4. </strong>Show the source and destination addresses in the IP header for the IP packets traveling from CH to HA.




<strong>Q5.</strong> Show the source and destination addresses in the IP header for the IP packets traveling from HA to FA.




<strong>Q6. </strong>Show the source and destination addresses in the IP header for the IP packets traveling from MH to CH (no ingress filtering).




<strong>Q7.</strong> Show the source and destination addresses in the IP header for the IP packets traveling from MH to CH (reverse tunneling used due to ingress filtering).




<strong>Q8</strong>. To accomplish handover in SCTP (with ADDIP extension), switching the primary address is necessary after adding a new address. The lecture notes list three different rules that suit three different contexts. Can you think of another rule (and context) that would be more appropriate than any of these three rules?




<strong>Q9.</strong> SCTP supports soft handover. Can TCP support the same? Why or why not?




<strong>Q10.</strong> Can TCP Migrate support simultaneous move of the two corresponding nodes (two end nodes of the TCP connection)? Why or why not, and what are the deployment implications (read the MOBICOM2000 paper).




<strong>Q11.</strong> What are the main advantages of network mobility (NEMO)?




<strong>Q12.</strong> What are the disadvantages of NEMO, if any?

<strong>Q13.</strong> What new infrastructure is needed to support NEMO?




<strong>Q14.</strong> You are boarding a bus with an onboard router, which has a permanent IP address of 129.20.6.7/16. If your laptop is configured to use co-located CoA, which of the following address is likely to be a CoA for you and why?




<ul>

 <li>20.6.7</li>

 <li>20.6.5</li>

 <li>21.6.7</li>

 <li>20.6.7</li>

</ul>
